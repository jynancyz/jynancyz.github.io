          &diams; &nbsp; Paper prototyping permits for ideations (a tactic of quick prototyping). </br>
          &diams; &nbsp; The user-experience interviews revealed some expectations that users already had for the interface. </br>
        &diams; How to use screen recording application to record performed tasks by interviewees. </br>

          The Process:
        </h1> </div>
      </br>
          <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto">
        <h4> 1. <u>Understanding Current Design of CommunityCrit </u> </h4>
        <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;">Although I was involved in user-testing for the interface, this first period of time was mostly dedicated to understanding the layout of the information on the webpage. Contributions are guided by specific questions but they lack a connection between other contributions. The comments hold a lot of important content that was not highlighted; it was difficult to parse through.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
</br>

        <div class="progress2" id="step2">
                <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto bg-light">
                </br>
        <h4> 2. <u> Rethinking Comment Categorization </u> </h4> </br>
        <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;">Brief literature review was done to understand various other methods of comment categorization and visualization. While there were many interesting methods, they were utilized for different forms of data and did not apply to the civic sphere. Instead, we focused on simpler forms of visualization such as timelines, summaries, and bars with colors and shades for coding. It was important for our choices of visualization to work for our target audience which includes members of the community at all education levels. </p></br>
      </div>
      
    </br>

  <div id="step3"> 
   <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto">

        <h4> 3. <u>First Iteration!</u></h4> </br>
        <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;"> In the first iteration, we aimed to modify the current idea page so each idea is more accessible and the sentiment bars as well as informative side panels will have space to display information. </p> </div>

    </br>

   <div id="step4">
          <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto bg-light">
</br>

    <h4> 4. <u>Adding Sentiment Analysis and Summary Panels</u></h4> </br>
    
    <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;"> The sentiments coded for comments of each idea is displayed in a bar with green representing comments with a positive sentiment, yellow representing neutral, and red representing negative. We had a discussion on the length and width of the bars- with the length corresponding to the amount of comments or increasing the width of ideas with more comments instead of expanding it length-wise. We experiemented with the same length and width for all ideas with our reasoning being it would not complicate the page. Summary panels are added on the right to include (on first page: Summary of project, in category: Summary of category of ideas). It provides users who do not have time to browse the page a way to get the information. </u> </p></div>


</br>

     <div id="step5">
          <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto">

    <h4> 5. <u>Second Iteration</u></h4> </br> 
    <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;">Since the audience for this webpage will include those of all ages and abilities, the consideration of color for the sentiment bar was important. Other examples that we looked at used purples and browns but required a key to understand the shading. Instead, we chose to stick with a grayscale to measure each sentiment. We also changed the sentiment bars to directly represent the number of comments in each idea. </p> </div>


</br>

    <div id="step6">
          <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto bg-light">
</br>
    <h4> 6. <u> Ideation for Criteria Sorting</br> </u></h4> </br>
    
    <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;"> As the previous redesign prototype catered to sentiment based coding, our new ideation is based on criteria coding - using the bar to code criteria instead of sentiment. This is challenging as there are many more criterion than there are sentiments. Our goal is to allow all displays to be visible without the user doing anything. With action required, there might be much fewer people who will see the summarization. However, the drawback of a complete display is clutter which can cause user frustration. </p> 
    
    <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;"> Along with the criteria coding, we are also sketching out a colorful and informative homepage where the project is introduced along with a timeline of events (past, present, future) marked for either online or offline engagement. The first prototype is currently on InVision and shared with civic leaders and planners for feedback. </p>
