        <p> &diams; &nbsp; Biases must be taken into account when the subject's position is considered in the research topic. </br>
          &diams; &nbsp; In-situ observation is crucial to obtaining a clear idea on how civic events work. </br>
          &diams; &nbsp; Solutions can introduce new problems; wicked problems plague the civic sphere. </br>
          &diams; &nbsp; Inclusivity allows for more insights; more interviews needed to be conducted to capture experience from eventgoers' point of view. </p>

        <h4> 1. <u>Literature Review: Learning More on Existing Issues/Solutions </u> </h4>
        <!--<img src="litreview.png">-->
        <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;"> Most of papers that were read and evaluated came from the ACM Digital Library. We focused on the previous years's CHI and CSCW papers. Through literature review, I scoped out methods that have been investigated in the civic sphere focusing on methods which include <strong>civic engagement online</strong>. While <strong>many papers describe the benefits of using technology</strong> to engage the public, there were also various issues that were raised such as a lack of moderation. </p>

        <!--<img src="data.png"> <img src="subheaders.png">-->
        <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;"">We found that most civic issues circle around three key elements: Scale, Transparency, and Convergence. These were supported by transcribed quotes from the conducted interviews with civic leaders and planners. The data was split into three categories concerning: Participation, Retention, and Openness of Process which line up with the civic issues found. </p> </div>

    <h4> 4. <u> Paper writing! </u></h4> 
    <!--<img src="drafts.png">-->
    <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;"">Along with two other team members, I contributed a total of five written drafts per section. These were re-iterated upon after discussion with the professor. These drafts were later inputted into LaTex and references were added to complete the draft. </p>  </br></div>
