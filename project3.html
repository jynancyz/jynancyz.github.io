        &diams; &nbsp; Analyzed and categorized data in spreadsheets both qulitatively and quantitatively </br> 
        &diams; &nbsp; Defined certain problematic features within the Spotify mobile application </br>
      &diams; &nbsp; Ideated redesigns based on two main problems in creating and managing playlists in the Spotify mobile app </br> </div>

        <p> &diams; &nbsp; Comparing interfaces from other similar applications was crucial to a successful redesign as it provides certain constraints. </br>
          &diams; &nbsp; Paper prototyping permits for ideations (a tactic of quick prototyping). </br>
          &diams; &nbsp; The user-experience interviews revealed some expectations that users already had for the interface. </br> </p>

          The Process:
        </h1> </div>
      </br>
          <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto">
        <h4> 1. <u> Assignment Required Understanding Existing + Ideating Redesign</u> </h4>
        <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;">The class was split into teams of four students. The expected process included interviewing, data analysis, prototyping, and ideating and creating a redesign.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
</br>

        <div class="progress2" id="step2">
                <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto bg-light">
                </br>
        <h4> 2. <u> Current User-Experiences Noted in In-Person Interviews </u> </h4> </br>
        <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;">All interviews were conducted in person with Master-Apprentice method. We asked for permission to have screen recordings of each user completing a list of actions which included creating a playlist and modifying it by adding and deleting songs. </p></br>
      </div>
      
    </br>

  <div id="step3"> 
   <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto">

        <h4> 3. <u>Analysis and Categorization of Interview Data</u></h4> </br>
        <img src=""> 
        <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;"> Data is categorized and analyzed on a spreadsheet to better understand each userâ€™s experience as well as the overall issues that exist. Screen recordings were taken of the users during the interview/task completion process. However, these were associated with Lookback.io and are expired/cannot be viewed without pay. We found that many users complained about not being able to better personalize their playlists due to the amount of time it takes to add songs. </p> </div>

    </br>

   <div id="step4">
          <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto bg-light">
</br>

    <h4> 4. <u>Definition of Most Common Problems With Comparisons</u></h4> </br>
    
    <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;"> Other popular music applications were researched to better understand the features of Spotify. There were certain features that ran  much more smoothly on other applications. Workflow graphs were completed to visually compare the functions of each application.<u>These features later inspired our redesigned features.</u> </p></div>


</br>

     <div id="step5">
          <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto">

    <h4> 5. <u> Redesign Prototypes on Paper</u></h4> </br>
    
    <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;"> In the image above, we ideated on the process of curating a playlist. At the moment, Spotify allows for "Discover Weekly" which provides users a playlist of songs that are similar to what they listen to. Our redesign would allow users to form their own mix based on existing mixes (including Discover Weekly).</p>

    
    <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;"> We also ideated ways on allowing for the addition and deletion of multiple songs at once. This was a prominent complaint from our interviews about the music player. Inspiration was drawn from the multiple selection function from other applications/"Select applicable" type lists.</p> </div>


</br>

    <div id="step6">
          <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto bg-light">
</br>
    <h4> 6. <u> High-Fidelity Renders Created</br> </u></h4> </br>
    
    <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;"> The mockup was created with an iPhone 7 template and retains all Spotify features that are currently on the application- the multiple selection option is an addition to accomodate the need for mass deleting and adding. The deletion process as seen above! User is able to select multiple songs to delete as opposed to deleting each song one at a time. </p> 
    
    <p style="font-family: Georgia, sans-serif;"> This multi-selection process is also applied to the adding songs function. In this case, the user can also choose to add an entire playlist (not just a single song!) The image below shows how a user can add playlists as well as songs!</p>
